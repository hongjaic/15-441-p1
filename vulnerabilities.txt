Vulnerabilities:

1) Connection reset by client
It seems that the server prioritizes incoming connections (connectiont to
accept) over IO requests. Meaning, that when a lot of connections come in at
the same time or consecutively, the server seems to handle the accepts first,
rather than initializing IO with already established connections. I think this
could be very inefficient.

2) signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)
I have handled broken pipe errors by have the server to just ignore them. This
seems to be fine right now, but having the signal ignored, rather than
properly handling it could cause problems potentially.

3) Speed
This might be a problem that is common to all servers tha uses the select()
function to multiplex. When I tested with thousands of connections (up to 10
thousand), many of the connections timed out. The server of course, was
intact.
