Test execution plans:

1) Run mulitple instances of the python test script
To test that the server is trully robust when a huge number of connections are
made, I ran a multiple number of test scripts at once. No matter how many
instances of the python script I ran, the server did not fail; however, the
client failed due to timeouts (because the server defers connections after 1024
cnnections. This was just a stress test.

2) Have the echo_client send data larger than the buffer size
This test ultimately failed. However, I think the reason was because the
echo_client expects all things to come back in one send.

3) Robust client: netcat
I tried sending large files (10MB+) to the server using netcat. The command
that I used is "nc hostaddr portnum < filename". With multiple instances of
netcat sending such larger files worked beautifully. This test indicates that my
server is able to handle files that are much larger than the buffer (also
multiple of them at once).
