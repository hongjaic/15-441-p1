Test execution plans:

1) Run mulitple instances of the python test script
To test that the server is trully robust when a huge number of connections are
made, I ran a multiple number of test scripts at once. No matter how many
instances of the python script I ran, the server did not fail; however, the
client failed due to timeouts (because the server defers connections after 1024
cnnections. This was just a stress test.

2) Have the echo_client send data larger than the buffer size
This test ultimately failed. However, I think the reason was because the
echo_client expects all things to come back in one send.

3) Robust client: netcat
I tried sending large files (10MB+) to the server using netcat. The command
that I used is "nc hostaddr portnum < filename". With multiple instances of
netcat sending such larger files worked beautifully. This test indicates that my
server is able to handle files that are much larger than the buffer (also
multiple of them at once).

Test execution plans:

1) Web Browser
For basic functionality of the liso_server, I used ordinary web browers to
send requests. When I saw my static liso page show up, I knew that the basic
functionality was working.

2) Apache Bench
I used the Apache Bench to test the robustness of the server. Using apache, I
tested for GETs and POSTs with high number of clients and high number of
concurrency. Follwing are the commands that I used.

ab -n 10000 -c 1000 http://localhost:port/
ab -n 10000 -c 1000 -p filename http://localhost:port

The test results varied every time.

3) Netcat
I sent a request using netcat and tried to see if I was getting the correct
response.

nc localhost port < replay.test > replay.out

4) Web-Sniffer (web-sniffer.net)
Web sniffer provided a very handy webapp for testing the functionalities.
